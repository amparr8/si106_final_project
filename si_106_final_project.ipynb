    "\n",
    "### Part 1.1: Search for music on the iTunes API\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function called `iTunesSearch` that accepts one argument---a search term and returns a list of results from the iTunes API. Your search should be limited to only include music tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1.2: Get a list of songs\n",
    "\n",
    "Write code that indefinitely asks the user for search terms (e.g., artist names, track names, etc.). For every search term the user enters, you should add the results from the iTunes API (part 1.1) to a list that tracks all the results. Your code should ask the user for search terms until they enter `'done'`. You should assign the list of results to a variable, which you will reference in part 2.\n",

    "## Part 2: Guess the song\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second part of this project, you will write code that implements a song-guessing game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.1: Pick a random song\n",
    "After creating a list of songs (part 1), your code should pick a song at random from that list. You should use  [the `random.choice()` method](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice) for this (be sure to import the `random` module).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.2: Play a song preview\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random song (2.1), your code should play an audio preview of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you must import a few features from the `IPython.display` module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from IPython.display import display, Audio, clear_output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After you do this, if you are given a URL for an audio file (suppose it is in the variable `audio_url`), you can play it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "display(Audio(audio_url, autoplay=True))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can try this with the audio url: `'https://audio-ssl.itunes.apple.com/itunes-assets/Music7/v4/cd/a8/4c/cda84ca4-3ef1-d2b5-6f88-3640e5db33fc/mzaf_1355556193908011287.plus.aac.p.m4a'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.3: Print a \"blanked out\" version of the song:\n",
    "\n",
    "After picking a random song (2.1) and playing a song preview (2.2), your code should\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace every **alphanumeric** character (meaning a-z, 0-9) in the track name with an underscore (`'_'`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a song titled `\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\"` should print out: `\"(_ ___'_ ___ __) ____________\"`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\n",
    "(_ ___'_ ___ __) ____________\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check if a character is alphanumeric with the `.isalnum()` method: `'a'.isalnum()` is `True`. `'#'.isalnum()` is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.4: Allow the user to guess the track name (or pass)\n",
    "After your code picks a random song (2.1), plays the song preview (2.2), and prints a \"blanked out\" version of the song (2.3), your code should repeatedly ask the user to guess the song. Every time, your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ask the user to enter a guess (using `input()`)\n",
    "- If the user guessed the correct track name, print `\"You got it!\"`.\n",
    "- If the user guessed incorrectly, print `\"It's not '<what the user entered>'\"`\n",
    "- If the user enters `'pass'` then your code should display the correct answer (`\"The song was '<track name>'\"`) and stop asking for guesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This part should **not** be case sensitive; if the correct answer is `'Thriller'` and the user guesses `'THRILLER'`, this should count as being correct. You can use Python strings' [`.upper()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.upper) method to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2.5: Indefinite rounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, your code should repeat parts 2.1--2.4 indefinitely (until the user types `'exit'`). Note that this means you will need to have nested `while` loops (one for 2.4 and one for this part). One way to achieve this would be to put the code for part 2.4 into a separate function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every round, your code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Print `'== ROUND <#> =='`, replacing `<#>` with the round number (`1`,`2`,`3`,...)\n",
    "2. Pick a random song (as implemented for 2.1)\n",
    "3. Play a preview of the song (as implemented for 2.2)\n",
    "4. Print a \"blanked out\" version of the song (as ipmlemented for 2.3)\n",
    "5. Allow the user to guess the song with an indefinite number of chances (as implemented for 2.4), with the following modification:\n",
    "    - If the user types `'exit'`, your code should display the correct answer, wait 3 seconds, and clear the output (see \\#6 for how to do this)\n",
    "    - The user should still be able to enter `'skip'` to skip to the next round. The difference between `'pass'` and `'exit'` is that `'pass'` should move on to the next round. `'exit'` should exit the guessing game entirely.\n",
    "6. After the user guesses correctly (or passes), your code should:\n",
    "    - Display the correct track name (if the user passed)\n",
    "    - Wait 3 seconds (you can do this by importing [the `time` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep) and calling `time.sleep(3)`\n",
    "    - Call `clear_output()` (imported from `IPython.display` earlier) to clean up the output.\n",
    "7. Increment the round and start up again at step 1"

    "Correctly implementing parts 1 and 2 as described above will earn you 60 points. The remaining 10 points require that you do something creative. What you do for this problem should be reasonably challenging (something that would not be possible to do with 10 lines of code or fewer). If you aren't sure if your idea is challenging enough, feel free to ask an instructor. Although none of the following additions *alone* would be enough, you can pick 2--3 of them (or do something else):\n",

    "- Time how long it takes for players to answer a question and give them more points if it doesn't take as long\n",

    "1. I added a hint portion to my code. If the user inputs 'hint' then a photo of the album cover that corresponds to the name of the song will apear to help the user guess the song. \n",
    "2. I added another portion to my code that times how long the user takes to guess the song. Also depending on how long it takes the user depends on how many points they receive. Each round the user starts off with 100 points and then the elasped time it takes to guess the song is subtracted from that 100 points. If the user guesses in less than 5 seconds they get an additional 15 points. A time stamp is taken immediatley once the song is played and then another time stamp is taken once the user guesses correctly. These two time stamps are subtracted in order to get the elasped time which is then subracted from the initial 100 points. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. I added an additional step which writes to a file called \"player_points.txt\" and also reads the file. This file contains a dictionary of the amount of points earned everytime the game is played/the code is ran. The amount of points is an accumulated amount of points during the rounds of game play. I used try and except blocks to ensure the code can still run if the file doesn't exist like at the start of the game. "
